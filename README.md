This is one of the projects of The Odin Project .

The challenge was to recreate the Google homepage from scratch and make it as visually accurate as possible with no concern for button or search funcionality.

It was a very fun introduction into both HTML and CSS and helped understand a lot of the concepts taught in previous lessons.

I started by dividing the homepage into different divs and positioned them in a drawing with pen and paper for better visualization.
This process helped with knowing what to do to the different divs in order to position them correctly.
After being able to get the general position correct, I used the devtools to get the correct dimensions and applied them to my CSS.

After being happy with the visual recreation, I added functionality to the links in the page so that they redirect to google's proper locations.
